Note: RTPack.exe is already included, you don't need to compile this!! (well, if you're on windows..)

This is only included because someone asked for the source to customize.. and in the secret hope that someone will port
it to linux, mac and other platforms.
--------------
This is a console application that converts textures to .rttex's, turns BMFont font files into .rtfont and other cool stuff.

Compiling it will take some skillz.

You'll need Clanlib 1.x (not 2.X!) and the PVRTexLib.
