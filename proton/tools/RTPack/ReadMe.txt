This is a console application that converts textures to .rttex's, turns BMFont font files into .rtfont and other cool stuff.

Compiling it will take some skillz.

You'll need Clanlib 1.x (not 2.X!) and the PVRTexLib.

It's for Windows only.  With some work it could be made to run under OSX/Linux as well though.
