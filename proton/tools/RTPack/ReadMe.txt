Note: RTPack.exe is already included, you don't need to compile this!!

This is only included because someone asked for the source to customize.. and in the secret hope that someone will port
it to linux.
--------------
This is a console application that converts textures to .rttex's, turns BMFont font files into .rtfont and other cool stuff.

Compiling it will take some skillz.

You'll need Clanlib 1.x (not 2.X!) and the PVRTexLib (used for making pvrtc format textures.. although this could be stripped
out for non windows build fairly easily... )

It's currently for Windows only.  With some work it could be made to run under OSX/Linux as well though.
