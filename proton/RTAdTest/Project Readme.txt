RTAdTest

This example is designed to test the AdManager and IAPManager.

To see what's really happening, you need to watch the output log as you run this, it won't show everything on the screen.

It currently supports:

* Using tapjoy on Android (including using managed points, full screen and banner ads, offer wall)
* Using In App Billing in Android Market

Tested to build with:

* Windows GLES
* Android
