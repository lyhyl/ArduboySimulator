-- About webos IAP --

To properly test IAP on webos, you have to:

* be using the SDK/Test version of the OS on your TouchPad (you know it's the right one when the store is nearly empty)
* Your palm device account's email must match your developer account
* Your palm device account must have the US or Canada set as its country
* You must run the store first and setup a credit card (supposedly fake is ok, but for me it seemed to need
a real one..)
* You have to setup test IAP items in the developer portal, and modify this example to call those item names
